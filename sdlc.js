    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The next step is to define and document requirements. Define what the application is meant to do, any features that would be included, and roadblocks along the way"
const design = "Next is to model how the application will warok and aspects of the design. After the design has been defined, a prototype of an early version of the software can be created to demonstrate a basic idea of how an application will look, how it will respond, and what it is capable of doing."
const implementation = "This is the phase where the program itself is written out, either using a single developer or a large team each working on different parts of the development."
const testingAndIntegration = "Applications must be tested continuously to ensure that they are going to run well together, as software development is often broken down into smaller projects completed by separate individuals and teams. Ensure that each function runs as it should and that each part of the application is interacting well with other parts."
const maintain = "Once the application has been deployed and is being used, the final phase discovers bugs that slipped through the cracks during testing and resolves them."
